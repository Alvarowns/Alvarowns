Since I was a kid I've been fascinated by the art and creation process in comics and video games, but ended working in a family business, which is nothing close to where I want to end when the retirement time comes.

Searching for a change I was tempted to learn Illustration and concept art, as I mention earlier the art in game industry still fascinate me. As I love to create things.

In that searching path I encountered courses for mobile development, and started to be more and more intrigued by... and realized IT'S AWESOME, I can create something useful and even be creative, two for one!

Eventually I enrolled in a Swift & SwiftUI course and here I am now, focused in building a new career path in native mobile development! ðŸ¥³
